## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the US road accidents dataset to gain insights into various aspects of accidents, such as their frequency, severity, time distribution, and geographic distribution. The analysis is performed using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

The dataset is loaded using Pandas and cleaned to handle missing and incorrect values. Exploratory analysis is performed to understand the data's structure and identify potential issues.

## Exploratory Analysis and Visualization

The analysis includes:
- Distribution of accidents by city, state, and timezone
- Impact of weather conditions on accidents
- Frequency of accidents by hour, day, month, and year
- Severity of accidents and its impact on traffic
- Geographic distribution of accidents using interactive maps

## Insights

The analysis yields insights such as:
- 50+ Insights 
- Most accident-prone cities and states
- Trends in accidents over the years
- Peak hours and days for accidents

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
